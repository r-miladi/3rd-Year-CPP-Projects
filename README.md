Object-Oriented Programming in C++

Final Project: Designed and implemented a C++ program which allows for the storage and manipulation of experimental data collected\linebreak for multiple different experiments. Implemented a flexible class hierarchy to store measurements of continuous, discrete and unitless quantities as well as bin frequency measurements, all of which could be stored in objects which hold sets of measurements for a given experiment. Developed algorithms to extract data from a file in a predetermined format and to perform basic analysis of a given set of data.Made use of an abstract base class for generic measurements with derived classes being implemented as specific
types of measurements. Made use of a template class for holding a generic discrete measurement. Created a polymorphic object for holding sets of different types of measurements taken at the same time, achieved through the use of smart pointers.
